# About ADK

ADK is a small C++ library and progressive electronics course for the Arduino
Mega 2560. It treats circuit parts as objects with explicit resource ownership,
safe lifetimes, deterministic behavior, native tests, and a complete physical
lesson for every interface.

The teaching method repeats deliberately:

1. predict the circuit's behavior;
2. build it inside a stated safety boundary;
3. observe and measure it;
4. diagnose discrepancies;
5. support a claim with recorded evidence; and
6. compose the proven component into the next circuit.

## Current status

ADK is early-stage software. Lessons 001--006 use the first-class per-object
RAII interfaces. They cover digital output and input, Button, Reaction Timer,
PWM and RGB output, passive piezo sound, and the deterministic Simon engine.
The APIs pass deterministic host tests and compile for the Mega 2560, but
physical acceptance remains open.

The hierarchy is developed in dependency order:

- hardware endpoints own pins, buses, timers, and interrupt claims;
- circuit components give endpoints physical meaning; and
- behaviors coordinate components without taking ownership of their physics.

The per-object lifecycle uses transactional `initialize()`, idempotent
`shutdown() noexcept`, and destructor-driven cleanup. The original
global-registration preview is frozen under [Legacy](legacy/index.md).

The next slice begins with analog input, calibration, and sampled filtering,
then composes them into the adaptive night light at lesson 009. See the
[roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) for the full sequence.

## Principles

- Mega 2560 hardware first, with portability expressed through honest board
  profiles.
- Composition before inheritance.
- No internal exceptions, RTTI dependency, or dynamic allocation.
- Explicit clocks, inputs, seeds, and replayable traces.
- Clean public headers and size-conscious out-of-line implementations.
- Host tests and physical evidence are complementary, not interchangeable.
- Safety boundaries are part of each interface and lesson.
