# Components

Status meanings:

- **Host verified** — strict deterministic tests pass.
- **Hardware experimental** — Mega build passes; bench card remains open.
- **Planned** — contract or curriculum placement only.

| Layer | Type | Status | Owns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core | `Runtime`, `ResourceClaim`, `TimePoint`, `Status` | Host verified | Fixed registry and explicit time |
| Endpoint | `DigitalOutput` | Hardware experimental | One output pin |
| Endpoint | `DigitalInput` | Hardware experimental | One input pin |
| Component | `MonoLed` | Hardware experimental | One `DigitalOutput` |
| Component | `Button` | Hardware experimental | One `DigitalInput` |
| Behavior | `ReactionTimer` | Hardware experimental | No hardware; observes Button and time |
| Later layers | PWM, analog, buses, displays, sensors, actuators | Planned | See catalog |

Composition is preferred: a Button has an input; it is not a specialized pin.
Behavior engines expose output intent rather than hiding hardware callbacks.
